### Project Overview

This project aims to provide insight into the employee survey data to help the HR department to improve employee satisfaction by analyzing and drawing out meaningful insights from the dataset.

**_Disclaimer_** : _all datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of PowerBi._

### Data Sources

Employee Survey Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'Employee Survey-HR Survey Responses.csv' file, containing detailed responses from an employee engagement survey conducted
by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees. The dataset is a Single table
and contains 14,725 records. The total number of fields is 10.

### Tools

- PowerBi [Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Analysis
  - Creating Report

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading, inspection and transforming
2. Data cleaning missing values to improve column quality to 100%
3. Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the following key questions:

- What percentage of employees completed the survey?

- Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

- Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

- As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey
  results?

### Data Analysis

The following PowerBi features were incorporated:

- Conditional Column
- Filters
- Interactive Slicers

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. **99%** of supervisors, staff and managers completed the survey while only **96%** of Directors completed the survey.

2. The question most employees agreed with was 'I know what is expected of me at work'. The one most disagreed with was 'In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.

3. From the analysis, the two departments which are unsatisfied across the 5 disagreed with questions are planning and public works and sherrif's department. The most unsatisfied employee roles are staff and supervisors. **52%** of staff in the planning department do not have a best friend at work. **70%** of the supervisors in the Sherrif's department feel unsatisfied with their job.

4. Since most staff and supervisors do not feel recognized for doing good work and feel their supervisors do not hold employees accountable for perfomance. As an employer, I would implement regular feedback and recognition opportunities with benefits that are tailored to the individual.

- Employees do not have close friends at work to make them feel valued and cared for, as an employer I would create opportunities to build relationships especially in the planning and public works department. This could be done by providing time and space for employees to get together for coffee or a shared activity to talk about their interests, goals and challenges.

- A number of employees feel the mission or purpose of the organisation does not make them feel their job is important. As an employer, I would provide mission driven work opportunities to help employees understand their impact on organizational strategy while supporting careers for market competitiveness.

- A large number of supervisors in the Sherrif's department are not satisfied with their job. As an employer, in addition to investigating the root cause of their unsatisfaction, I would ensure that they are appropriately challenged. Focusing on each employee's learning curve to make sure its at a steep enough angle based on where they are in their career journey. Most employees crave new challenges when theyâ€™ve been in a role too long or just got overburdened.
