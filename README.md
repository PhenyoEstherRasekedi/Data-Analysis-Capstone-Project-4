### Project Overview

This project aims to provide insight into the employee survey data to help the HR department to improve employee satisfaction by analyzing and drawing out meaningful insights from the dataset.

**_Disclaimer_** : _all datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country, but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate capabilities of PowerBi._

### Data Sources

Employee Survey Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'Employee Survey-HR Survey Responses.csv' file, containing detailed actual responses from an employee engagement survey conducted
by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees. The dataset is a Single table
and contains 14,725 records. The total number of fields is 10.

### Tools

- PowerBi [Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Analysis
  - Creating Report

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading, inspection and transforming
2. Data cleaning missing values to improve column quality to 100%
3. Data formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the following key questions:

- Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

- What percentage of employees completed the survey?

- Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

- Is the company meeting employee wellbeing?

- As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey
  results?

-

### Data Analysis

The following PowerBi features were incorporated:

- Conditional Column
- Filters
- Interactive Slicers

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The question most employees agreed with was 'I know what is expected of me at work'. The one most disagreed with was 'In the last seven days, I have received recognition or praise for doing good work.

2. 99% of employees completed the survey, this is important because hearing their feedback and taking action gives employees a voice and leads to increased satisfaction, resulting in a happier workforce with a better sense of belonging. This positive attitude can boost morale and increase retention.

3. When employees feel valued and cared for, they will be more engaged and more productive, which benefits the company as well.

4. Since most do not feel recognized for doing good work and feet their supervisors do not hold employeed accountable for perfomance. As an employer, I would train supervisors to offer regular feedback and recognition opportunities with benefits that are tailored to the individual.
